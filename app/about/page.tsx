            At the Austin STEM Center (ASC), we create the space and
            opportunity for learning to leave the classroom and come to life in
            the real world. We believe that when learning is hands-on, applied,
            and connected to real challenges, that is where true impact is
            made. ASC is innovating how STEM is taught by making learning
            active, accessible, and grounded in real tools, systems, and
            problem-solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a nonprofit innovation hub partnered with ATX Robotics Inc., ASC
            brings together schools, companies, and communities to grow real
            talent and solve real problems. Our facilities and programs support
            a wide range of learning experiences, including robotics,
            engineering, manufacturing, and emerging technologies. With spaces
            like our in-house FIRST Robotics arena alongside fabrication labs
            and learning environments, ASC functions as a support community
            where learners can explore interests, build skills, and discover
            pathways connected to real-world applications.

          <p>
            In 2025, Peter Wang, Evan Marchman, and Ken Hawthorn came
            together with a shared vision: to create a place where students
            could truly experience STEM through hands-on learning, innovation,
            and real-world opportunity. Each founder brought a unique set of
            skills, experience, and perspective to the table, alongside the
            foundational support and investment provided by Peter Wang.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within just a few short months, a building was secured, an
            incredible team was assembled, and Austin STEM Center began
            building programs designed to ignite curiosity, creativity, and
            confidence in students of all backgrounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Austin STEM Center exists to inspire the next generation of
            innovators, problem-solvers, engineers, and leaders by making STEM
            education accessible, engaging, and impactful for the community.
